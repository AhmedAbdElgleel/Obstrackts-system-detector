![Distance Detector System](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=11RteDtgCxKBif4ACqKI966ETUhyY9II6)

## System Overview
This project implements a Distance Measurement System using the ATmega32 microcontroller with a frequency of 16MHz and the HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor. It measures distances and displays them on a 2x16 LCD in centimeters using 4-bit data mode. The project follows a layered architecture model, consisting of GPIO, ICU, LCD, and Ultrasonic drivers.

## System Requirements
### Hardware
- ATmega32 Microcontroller with a frequency of 16MHz.
- HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor. Refer to the "HC-SR04 Ultrasonic MT Student Tutorial" PDF for interfacing details.
- A 2x16 LCD with 4-bit data mode.

### üîπ **Structured Architecture Model**:
Our system is built on a well-organized architecture model:

**HAL Layer (Hardware Abstraction Layer)**: Encompassing LCD, HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor, LED, and Buzzer, this layer simplifies hardware complexities, enhancing overall efficiency.

**MCAL Layer (Microcontroller Abstraction Layer)**: Managing GPIO and Input Capture Unit (ICU), this layer ensures fundamental hardware control, enabling seamless interaction between software and microcontroller components.

### üîπ **Intelligent LED and Buzzer Feedback**:
Our system provides intelligent feedback based on distance:

- ‚â§ 20cm: Red LED activates.
- ‚â§ 15cm: Green and Red LEDs illuminate.
- ‚â§ 10cm: All LEDs light up.
- ‚â§ 5cm: Buzzer activates, accompanied by blinking LEDs, signaling critical proximity.

## Getting Started
1. Connect the ATmega32 microcontroller with a frequency of 16MHz, HC-SR04 sensor, and 2x16 LCD in 4-bit data mode according to the specified hardware requirements.
2. Load the provided code onto the ATmega32 microcontroller.
3. Power up the system.

## Usage
- The Ultrasonic sensor will measure distances and display them on the connected 2x16 LCD using 4-bit data mode.
- The LED and buzzer will react according to the specified distance ranges.
